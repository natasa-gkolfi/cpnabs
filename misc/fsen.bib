  abstract="Actor-based languages attract attention for their ability to
                  scale to highly parallel architectures. Active objects
                  combine the asynchronous communication of actors with
                  object-oriented programming by means of asynchronous
                  method calls and synchronization on futures. However, the
                  combination of asynchronous calls and synchronization
                  introduces communication cycles which lead to a form of
                  communication deadlock. This paper addresses such
                  communication deadlocks for ABS, a formally defined
                  active object language which additionally supports
                  cooperative scheduling to express complex distributed
                  control flow, using first-class futures and explicit
                  process release points. Our approach is based on a
                  translation of the semantics of ABS into colored Petri
                  nets, such that a particular program corresponds to a
                  marking of this net. We prove the soundness of this
                  translation and demonstrate by example how the
                  implementation of this net can be used to analyze ABS
                  programs with respect to communication deadlock.",
