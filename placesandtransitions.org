* Introduction

The (simple) file contains in tabular form an overview over the places and
transitions of the CPNs used in the model of the paper. The submission
contains a number of screenshots taken from the tool as figures. They are
also reproduced here (under [[./images]]) for better viewing. Each figure
contains a functionally related subpart of the global net, for instance,
covering differnent aspects of the semantics. The global net itself is too
big to be reproduced in its entirety in the paper.  Each submodule
resp. figure contains a number of places and transitions. Those places and
transitions are numbered (besides carrying a more telling name). Sometimes,
places and transitions are ``shared'' between different submodules
resp. connecting different submodules. Consequently, those places or
transitions are mentioned in /more/ than one figure. 


The shown table gives an overview, where each place resp. transition can be
found as contributing to that submodule's functioning.
