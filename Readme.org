* In a nutshell

This repos contains the *colored Petri nets  model* (``cpn'' model) for the
semantics of the active object language ABS. It is accomapnying material
for a submitted work. The tool-readable file is downloadable from:

#+begin_center
     [[imperative_layerRefactor.cpn]]
#+end_center

 

* System requirements and how to use the model

The model is produced with [[http://cpntools.org/][ *CPN tools* ]]. The tool set it freely available
under the given link. Please follow the information under [[http://cpntools.org/][the tool's
webpage]] for installation instructions, system requirements, documentation,
and licensing information.


* Additional material

The background of the model has been earlier, in a shorter and preliminary
conference version published as /Translating Active Objects into Colored
Petri Nets for Communication Analysis/. In: Dastani M., Sirjani M. (eds)
Fundamentals of Software Engineering. FSEN 2017. Lecture Notes in Computer
Science, vol 10522. Springer. See also the [[./misc/fsen.bib][bib-entry]] and the [[https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-68972-2_6][Springer DOI

** Images 

The paper contains a number of images which are screenshots taken from the
cpn-tool.  


They are reproduced here for better viewing in the directory
[[./images]]. The numbers listed here correspond to the numbers as they appear
in the long version of the paper. The repository here contains /only/ the
screenshots, not other schematic figures, tables, or illustrations in the
paper (hence, the numbering of the figures does not start with number 1).

** Transitions and places

The following shows in tabular form an overview over the places and
transitions of the CPNs used in the model of the paper. The numbers in the
colums refer to the number of the images (reproduced under [[./images]]). Each
figure contains a functionally related subpart of the global net, for
instance, covering differnent aspects of the semantics. The global net
itself is too big to be reproduced in its entirety in the paper.  Each
submodule resp. figure contains a number of places and transitions. Those
places and transitions are numbered (besides in most cases carrying a more
telling name). Sometimes, places and transitions are ``shared'' between
different submodules resp. connecting different submodules. Consequently,
those places or transitions are mentioned in /more/ than one figure.


The shown table gives an overview, where each place resp. transition can be
found as contributing to that submodule's functioning.  The first rows of
the table are the transitions, the lower part of the table lists the
places.
